## Tips for Writing Achievements

1. **Quantify everything**: Use numbers (users, %, latency, uptime, etc.)
2. **Use action verbs**: Led, Built, Designed, Implemented, Reduced, Improved
3. **Be specific**: Mention technologies and methodologies
4. **Show impact**: Connect technical work to business outcomes
5. **Match keywords**: Include terms that appear in job descriptions you want
